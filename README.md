# Crux
Crux is a pet project of mine to unify the front end and back end of JavaScript.
It's meant to abstract away the need for creating html, css, and javascript for the
frontend by generating these files based off the backend.

Like many libraries, Crux is component based. The main advantage of using Crux comes
from it eliminating the need to maintain both a frontend and a backend separately.
Its structure allows for server-side logic to sit right beside client-side logic in
a more intuitive way, while still generating a logical and readable frontend.
